# About this project
This project is part of a university requirement called TCU, which consists of supporting companies through technology. The software solution is made up of 3 parts: database, API and frontend application.
In this project you can manage the clinical records that the company uses to keep track of its clients/patients. In addition, it has an administrative section that allows you to manage the users of the application. The application has CRUD of operations both at the user and patient level, password reset and the possibility of saving images. This project was created by the hand of my colleague Dylan Castillo, his GitHub is here: https://github.com/QuiqueCode
